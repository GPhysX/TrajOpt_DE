I would like to sincerely express my gratitude to my guide Dr. Ramanan R. V for the support, guidance and discussions during the course of the project. I also wish to thank my parents for their constant encouragement.\\
I take this opportunity to thank the developers and contributors of the Boost library and the C++ Standards Committee for building the C++ programming language and it's libraries to the extent it is today. I would also like to thank Bill Gray, the developer of the ephemeris code, "Project Pluto" which my current work hugely benefited from. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA has my appreciation for publishing exhaustive ephemeris data in the public domain.
