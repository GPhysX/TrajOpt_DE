Don't muck up anything. Don't touch anything unless you're sure that you won't break it. 

I'm joking, mess around with the code as much as you like but keep a backup so that you can roll back stupid and incorrect stuff.

Try to keep inheritance to a minimum. So far I haven't used it but in case you do, be cautious with it.

Don't bother with run time polymorphism. Too much trouble for what it's worth.

That's all I have to say.

Goodbye.
